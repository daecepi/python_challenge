__Note:__ Since the evaluators can be anyone inside the company the documentation was let simple and quite explanatory

## Approaches
- Modularizing the code as much as possible according to requerement's actual understanding
- Mathematics for point mapping instead of constant looping
- Usage of

## Part of the exercise description
You will be given a square chess board with one queen and a number of obstacles placed on it. Determine how many squares the queen can attack.

A queen is standing on an n x n  chessboard. The chess board's rows are numbered from 1 to n , going from bottom to top. Its columns are numbered from 1 to n, going from left to right. Each square is referenced by a tuple, (r,c) , describing the row, r , and column, c , where the square is located.

The queen is standing at position (rq, cq) . In a single move, she can attack any square in any of the eight directions (left, right, up, down, and the four diagonals). In the diagram below, the green circles denote all the cells the queen can attack from (4,4):
